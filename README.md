# weather-dashboard
displays current weather and forecast for user-selected city

## Description

This page accepts user-input city names and then gets current and forecasted weather data from the OpenWeather api, and displays it on the page.

## Features

Displays date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
Saves selected cities as buttons for ease of access, and stores them in local storage for subsequent page visits.
Displays appropriate icons and background images to match weather conditions.

## Opportunities For Further Development

I would like to improve the handling of bad user input. Most notably, cities that don't return weather data should not be saved to buttons and local storage.

I would like to have a small delete button on each of the larger city buttons to let the user manage their city list.

I would like to add additional background images to display appropriately for day and night.
